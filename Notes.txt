with your poll points (+1 for every like)

On the home page, you can post a new poll, or view all your polls. There is also an option for settings, and an option to view polls you have voted on

The hot page will have the most liked, voted, and commented posts over the past 24 hours. Once a poll is over 24 hours old, it is no longer eligible in hot page.

New will have chronological order of polls

Followers will have chronological posts from users you followed.

Thing mentioned in group chat:
-we need to somehow code a whole admin shit otherwise we have to remove it directly from database
-on resize, put both id="form" and id="feed" in the center
-once the java script and css is done, we should implement it in the index, because otherwise the website will call for 3 HTTP requests

-How bout an analytics page where we show graphs of number of votes and polls and comments and shit
-I was also thinking of a hidden page showing top posters and commenter And top voters
-I need you to make the nav bar not looked so fucked when zooming


Things I want to include
- Daily poll (everybody votes on it, submitted by a user)
- Search Bar
- option to let users add options/disable
- option to let users select multiple answers/disable
- alerts (replies/ comments, update information, ect)
- bracket type polls. Users post one of these with all the options and people vote on them. Voters will be alerted when the bracket is open again

Things we may wanna change
-In mobile make the menu bar grow down and out of the button. So that you press the menu button to close the menu.
